# Introduction

The project is about the creation of an accessible and transparent database to serve a group of people (Batch Bente Nueve/B2029), where all information regarding the batch will be stored in a singular and unified website.

It aims to include all information regarding batch finances, events, and students and its life, while also allowing for easier storage and transcription of required data. This would include forms needed by students, submissions for different events, applications, et cetera.

This hopes to eventually make student and administrator life easier, especially in terms of **paperwork.**

> *This is inspired by the campaign of the L.U.M.E.N. Partylist for the S.Y. 2025 - 2026 Batch Council Elections.*

# The Front End: HTML Segment

The HTML Segment represents how the different parts of the website will be linked, alongside the key parts of each webpage.

The Website has the following parts:

1. Home Page:

    This is where visitors will be welcomed. It will include the main data to be shown to the students, such as video clips regarding the batch, links to different segments of the batch, and other data.

2. Navigation Bar:

    This is where links to general segments of the website can be accessed. Sites that can accessed through this page would be the likes of: Sign-in, Events, Reviewers (ARCHERS), Forms, Home (for other pages), and other parts that I will think of soon.

3. Side Bar:

    This is where more specific pages can be accessed, such as subcategories of the main websites. (e.g. Events -> ALAB 2026 / Family Day 2026-28 / Mid-S.Year Fair 2028, or Reviewers -> STEM/HUMMS)

4. Sign-in Page:

    This area is where the students will be allowed to log into the website to access batch-specific functions, such as administrator access to the website to allow for editing, etc.

5. Events:

    This area is where different information regarding events held by B2029 can be found, which may be utilized for events such as ALAB 2026, future Family Days, future Intramurals, Mid-School Year Fair 2028, and other significant events.

6. Documents

    These will include possible editors for all documents needed by the students to be filed, such as S.I.P. forms, Club forms, SDO forms, DSA forms, and others.

# Beautification: CSS Segment

    The CSS Segment will allow for the website to be organized into different segments, with additional aesthetics for each of these segments.

# The Back End: JavaScript Segment

The JavaScript has two main uses:

a. Transistion for different elements: It will allow for elements such as the side navigation bar to transistion, while also allowing for easy page changes through editing the main code.

b. Aesthetics: It will allow for cool features such as animation to run through the website.

c. Database: An entire database will be run on JavaScript, allowing for data to be stored within the website.

d. Encryption: JavaScript allows for certain elements to be run through processes that allows for its data to be encrypted by the server.
