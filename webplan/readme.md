# Introduction

The project is about the creation of an accessible and transparent database to serve a group of people (Batch Bente Nueve/B2029), where all information regarding the batch will be stored in a singular and unified website.

It aims to include all information regarding batch finances, events, and students and its life, while also allowing for easier storage and transcription of required data. This would include forms needed by students, submissions for different events, applications, et cetera.

This hopes to eventually make student and administrator life easier, especially in terms of **paperwork.**

> *This is inspired by the campaign of the L.U.M.E.N. Partylist for the S.Y. 2025 - 2026 Batch Council Elections.*
